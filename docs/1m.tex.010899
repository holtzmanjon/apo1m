\section{Telescope}

\begin{itemize}
\item Telescope is an alt-az Ritchey-Chretien design and produces an F/6.06 
beam.

\item Basic design optical parameters (units are inches)

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
NAME & RADIUS & THICKNESS & DIAMETER & CONIC \\
Primary & -200 & -62.66 & 40 & -1.202461 \\
Secondary & -127.059 & 40.1585 & & -8.434993 \\
Tertiary & Inf & 30 & & \\
Rotator mount & & 11.93 & \\
Focal plane & & & 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

At this point, we have essentially no information as to how the as-built
optical parameters match these design parameters.

\item Rotator mounting details: 12(?) hole bolt pattern with 1/4-20 bolts 
spaced evenly on a circle 14 inches diameter. From the center of the
rotator, you can mount anything out to a radius of 12 inches. Once you
are back 6 inches from the rotator, there is some additional clearance;
by the time you are 8 inches from the rotator, there are no constraints
on a mounted instrument.

\item Alt-az-rotator system has 3 axes of motion; at current time, rotator
exists on only one of the Nasmyth ports. Altitiude and azimuth axes have
limit switches and magnetic home sensors. Rotator axis does not have
limit switches, only a magnetic home sensor; to avoid rotator cable wrap
problems, the rotator position must be carefully stored using software
and remembered from session to session.

\item All drives are friction drives. Altitude and azimuth have friction
driven encoders as well; rotator only has the motor drive. On the
azimuth axis, there is clear evidence that the ``scale'' of the axis,
degrees/mm, varies slowly with temperature despite the fact that the
material of the drive shaft and drive wheel are the same. We have plans
to implement a temperature-dependent scale to correct for this to
first order.

\end{itemize}

\section{Instrument}

\subsection{Current instrument}

\begin{latexonly}

\end{rawhtml}
\end{htmlonly}

Current design has a spacer box mounted on rotator mount, which has a
back mounting plate 5.25" behing the rotator mount. An off-axis guider
camera is located inside this box, mounted to the back plate.  This
mount holds a 1.25" diagonal mirror along with a SpectraSource 512x512
CCD camera with 20 micron pixels.  The center of the guider is currently
located $\sim$ 2300 arcseconds off axis.  However, at the current time,
the diagonal mirror housing partially vignettes the beam going to the
science instrument.  There is currently no corrector in front of the
guider.

Behind the spacer, a filter wheel is mounted. The current filter wheel
is 3.5" thick. It accomodates 6 2" square filters. 

Behind the filter wheel, the science CCD camera is located. It has a
focal plane which is located 1.25 " (optical distance) behind the
mounting surface. The science CCD is 1024x1024 array put together 
by Princeton Instruments. The CCD pixels are 24 microns square.

The current design places the CCD array about 2 inches closer to the
secondary than is suggested by ray-tracing using the nominal optical
parameters.

\subsection{New instrument}

We are currently having a new guider and filter wheel being built by
\htmladdnormallink{Astronomical Consultants and Equipment}
{http://www.astronomical.com} (Peter Mack) out of Tucson. 
The idea is to make a much thinner filter
wheel which will allow the guider to be located much closer to the
focal plane. This will allow the guider to come closer on-axis without
vignetting the primary beam to the science instrument. This is motivated
so we can maximize the size of baffles in the system to minimize scattered
light, which currently poses a problem. 

For more information on specifications for the new system provided to
Peter, see \htmladdnormallink{this document}{../newinst/index.html}.

\section{Computer and software control}

The telescope, science CCD and filter wheel, and guider CCD are each
controlled by a separate PC. The telescope is controlled by the TOCC
computer, running DOS, the science CCD by the PI computer running 
Windows 3.11, and the guider CCD by the SPEC computer running DOS.

An original version of the alt-az control system running on the TOCC
computer was written by the AutoScope corporation, but this had many
problems and large portions of it have been rewritten (by Jon Holtzman) 
to form the current version. This software also controls the dome
and dome shutter, as well as commandable fill system for the CCD dewar.

The science CCD is controlled by software provided by Princeton Instruments.

The guide CCD is controlled by software written by Jon Holtzman using
library routines provided by SpectraSource.

All three programs look, in addition to input from the local keyboard(s),
for input in specified files which are visible over the network. This
allows for complete remote operation.

For remote operation, a suite of programs (tcomm) is run from a UNIX
workstation. Basically, a program is run which talks with each of the
three computers in the dome. In addition, there is a master command
program which is the user interface and sends commands to the UNIX client
programs. There is also a status program which monitors status files sent
back from the telescope and the CCD programs and displays a status
window with the current pointing of the telescope, exposure/filter 
information, etc.  Finally there is a program which controls the power
to various devices in the dome via a network power switching device.

\section{Current telescope performance}

\subsection{Pointing/tracking}

The telescope after nominal mechanical optical alignment has very poor
pointing performance. However, the pointing can be fairly well modelled
using standard terms for an alt-az telescope implemented, e.g., by the
TPOINT software, which we use. When making a pointing model using 100-200
stars around the sky, we typically achieve rms pointing performance 
of $\sim$ 20 arcsec.

Tracking performace directly comes from this pointing performance because
we track using encoder information in the same way that we point.  The
tracking performance varies with location in the sky. Typically, we
estimate that moderately good tracking, i.e. image quality can be maintained,
for roughly 3-5 minutes.

\subsection{Guiding}

We have implemented guiding software to allow for longer integrations.
With the current system, we perform relatively slow guiding; we can
update roughly once every 1-2 seconds fastest. Our usual mode of operation
is to operate significantly slower, usually computing an offset every
1-2 seconds but averaging five of these before sending a correction to
the telescope.

The performance of the guiding still depends on the quality of the
pointing model because we only have position measurements of the guide
star in two coordinates while the telescope is a three axis system.
We currently assume that the rotator position is correct, and guide
in alt-az alone. This appears to be sufficient so long as the pointing
model is good; when it is not good, we get noticable rotation around the
position of the guide camera when we are guiding. Better guiding can
also be obtained if the observer is careful to rezero the coordinate
pointing immediately before guiding (i.e. setting the pointing to be
correct to first order).

Our current guiding performance has yet to be fully quantified.

\subsection{Image quality}

The image quality currently leaves quite a bit to be desired. We have
never achieved image quality much better than $\sim$ 1.9 arcsec.

We have attempted to collimate the telescope several times. We have
twice done mechanical collimation by 
\begin{enumerate}
\item positioning the secondary (decenter and tilt) based on an alignment 
telescope mounted in the primary hole
\item positioning the tertiary (tilt only) based on an alignment telescope
mounted on the rotator mount
\item positiong the primary based on stellar images
\end{enumerate}

From this initial mechanical alignment, we have refined the collimation
using secondary tilts to minimize the apparent coma in the images. 
The secondary can be tilted using motor control, but not decentered.

Out-of-focus images show no strong signs of coma or astigmatism. However,
they do show very prominent, roughly azimuthally-symmetric, zonal
errors. At the current time, we suspect that the poor image quality
arises from one or more misfigured optics. The primary support system 
is also a possible culprit, but it is not clear how it would produce
azimuthally symetric features, as the primary support structure consists
of a set of three ``tripod'' cup mounts.

We currently have limited data on whether the  current best image quality 
can be achieved reliably. Anecdotal reports suggest there may be some
problem here, possibly with repeatability of the secondary mirror position.
