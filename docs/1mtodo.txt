easy/fast items, high priority:

 - o-ring for filter wheel/CCD interface. Document correct size and order a 
   couple.

 - find a place you can get a 4-way 25-pin switchbox from that will accept
   credit card and order

 - get plate built for Nasmyth port to hold alignment telescope

 - clean up dome

 - lubricate dome VERY thoroughly (don't have to worry about contamination
   of optics!)

harder items, don't require significant APO support, in priority order:

 - redo guider/filter wheel wiring. Cut off current ends and put connectors
   further down. Build a set of connectors to go between long cables and
   the guider/filter boxes, building extras for easy replacement. Reroute
   cables out along axis to reduce stress on connectors.

 - diagnose and fix filter wheel (assuming cabling problems weren't the
   culprit)

 - rewire limit "chooser" switch, with better connections and a cover over
   the connections

 - determine whether it is possible to replace guider pickoff mirror
   with larger mirror. Actually, should probably first determine whether
   mirror really is undersized. Note if we went to larger detector for
   guider, we might require a larger mirror.

 - figure out nicer way to install fans in front of louvers. Consider
   getting larger fans?

 - investigate whether Apogee could be used as guide camera. If located
   outside the box, does it have sufficient clearence? If this is feasible,
   investigate design and purchase of transfer optics

 - do a Nasmyth baffle design, and install correct baffles in proper
   locations using RTV

bigger jobs requiring support, listed in priority order:

 - design/construct/implement improved mirror cover system

 - get lower dome functioning reliably

 - investigate dome motor/dome interface, redesign as necessary

 - investigate redesign of tertiary mount, allowing for easier adjustment

 - investigate solutions for excess heat in rack: replace current AC unit,
   replace entire rack with better unit, venting of heat out of the dome,
   etc.
