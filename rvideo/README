Various versions of pwc and pwcx:

On RHEL4, the camera works fine at all resolutions just with built-in
  modules, nothing else is necessary.

I got things to run with RHEL3 kernel 2.4.21-32.0.1 by recompiling
  kernel using the configs/kernel-2.4.21-i686-smp.config file; even
  though this is supposed to match the distributed kernel, the distributed
  kernel did not have pwc included, but my custom one did!

With pwc, the camera only works at the minimum 160x120 resolution, for
  more than the pwcx is needed. I got the module from pwcx-8.4.tar.gz
  and it works! Need to modprobe pwcx first, however, or use something like
   post-install pwc /sbin/insmod --force /lib/modules/2.4.21-32.0.1.ELcustom/kernel/drivers/usb/pwcx.o >/dev/null 2>&1
  in /etc/modules.conf

Clearly, using compiled code is preferable, but I failed on that:
  I could not get pwc-9.0.2, nor pwc-10.0.7a to compile
    under 2.4.21-32.0.1
  The pwcx-9.0.2 source needs a pwc-9 to be compiling, but the version
    in the kernel source tree is 8.10
