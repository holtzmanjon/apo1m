Linux Apogee drivers and SDK
----------------------------

This distribution contains the Apogee camera driver development environment 
for the Linux (x86, x64, rpi-raspian) and Mac OS X operating systems. 

The users/programmers documentation is in the doc subdirectory

in ps, rtf, and html formats.

NOTE : The driver software was refactored on 2012 to add support for the new
cameras. At this point the version numbering was revised.
