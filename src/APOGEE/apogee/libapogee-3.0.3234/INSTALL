APOGEE IMAGING SYSTEMS LIBRARY:
=============================================================

PACKAGES:
=========
The main package of this distribtion is the Apogee devcie API,
libapogee. libapogee consists of C++ shared object, include files,
and configuration files.

pyLibapogee is subpackage in this distribuion.  It is is a SWIG
generated Python wrapper for libapogee.


LIBAPOGEE DEPENDENCIES:
=======================
libapogee depends on libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/) and
libusb-1.0 (http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libusb-1.0) and
Boost Regex (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html).
Please ensure these packages are installed before trying
to make libapogee.

For Ubuntu the libcurl4-openssl-dev, libusb-1.0.0-dev, and
libbost-regex.1.33.1-dev or greater packages can be installed
from the Ubutunu software repository for making libapogee.


PYLIBAPOGEE DEPENDENCIES:
=========================
pyLibapogee depends on SWIG, perferrable v2.0 or greater,
Python development files, the python-dev in the Ubuntu
package repository and the Numpy Python module.


JLIBAPOGEE DEPENDENCIES:
=========================
jLibapogee depends on SWIG, perferrable v2.0 or greater and
a java JDK.  On Unbuntu OpenJDK is recommended.


BUILDING AND INSTALLATION:
=========================

***************

To build and install only libapogee, decompress the library
files then execute the following commands in the top directory:

./configure
make
make install ( or sudo make install )

Typically the installation will place the header files in the
/usr/local/include/libapogee-VERSION NUMBER/apogee directory,
the library files in the /usr/local/lib directory, and the
configuration files in the /usr/local/etc/Apogee directory.

***************

To build and install libapogee and pyLibapogee execute the
following commands in the top directory:

./configure --enable-python-wrapper
make
make install ( or sudo make install )

Typically the installation will place the python module
in the /usr/local/lib/pythonVERSION/dist-packages/pyLibapogee
folder.

***************

To build and install libapogee and jLibapogee execute the
following commands in the top directory:

./configure --enable-java-wrapper
make
make install ( or sudo make install )

Typically the installation will place the java jar and shared library
in the /usr/local/share/java folder.

***************
To install libapogee in a location other than /usr/local, /usr for the
library and /etc for the configuration files for example then use the
--prefix and --sysconfig configure options.

./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfig=/etc
make
make install ( or sudo make install )

COMPILING AND LINKING:
======================
If your installation is to not to a directory in the PATH,
then ensure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains the path
to the libapogee shared objects, typically /usr/local/lib.
