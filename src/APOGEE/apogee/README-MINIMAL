Apogee ALTA driver source kit
-----------------------------

This distribution is intended for use by people who are
adding ALTA capability to other packages. It contains the
minimal set of source code you need to accomplish this.
To build the standard set of drivers and GUI's included
in the more comprehensive archives you will also need the
following packages :

	tcl/tk 8.3 or later
	curl 7.11 or later
	SWIG 1.3a5
	cfitsio
	BWidget 1.2.1
	Tix 4.1.0
	BLT 2.4

	libusb 0.1.8 or later (ALTA-U)

If you simply wish to add expose/readout capablities to
your own code, please study /opt/apogee/src/apogee/test_alta.cpp
first.
