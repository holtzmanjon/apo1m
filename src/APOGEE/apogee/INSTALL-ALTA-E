Installation notes for ALTA network cameras
-------------------------------------------

The user manual is on the cdrom in
 
        opt/apogee/doc
 
in a variety of formats.
 
 
 
To install the driver runtime (as superuser aka root)
 
        mkdir /opt/apogee
        cd /
        tar -xvzpf /mnt/cdrom/apogee-driver-2.2.tgz
        /opt/apogee/apogee_post
  
        (if you will be developing software, install using the
         apogee-driver-devel-2.2.tgz archive instead)
 

The ALTA-E series cameras operate over standard ethernet
and do not require a kernel module. 

Log in with the username you will use to operate the
camera, and type

	/opt/apogee/scripts/altaDiscover

A small window will appear logging progress of the search.

The camera obtains its IP address from a DHCP server on
your local network. This means that every time the 
camera is powered on it may obtain a different IP
address. In this case you will have to run 

	/opt/apogee/scripts/altaDiscover

again each time.

To avoid this you can configure the camera to have a static
IP address. Run altaDiscover once to obtain the current
address. Then start a webrowser and navigate to 

	http://address-reported-by-altaDiscover

The cameras onboard webserver shows a welcome page.
Choose the "Configure Network properties" option.
Use a username of "admin" and password of "configure"
to access the page.

Disable the DHCP option, and then enter the cameras
IP address in the appropriate box. Use the same
network mask and gateway settings that were reported
on the welcome page. Then click "Commit" to save the
settings. 

Once you have setup the camera with a static IP address,
it is also a good  idea to enter this address into the
hosts database on your machine. 

For example, if the IP address is 192.168.0.100, then 
add the following line to /etc/hosts (as root)


192.168.0.100 	alta	alta.localdomain
