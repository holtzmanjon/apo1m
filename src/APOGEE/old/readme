Dear Linux Developers;

Version 4.3 is the first release of the Apogee Camera Control library
source code that is compatible with Linux. This is considered a pre-
liminary release, please send comments and criticism to the email
address below.

The included LICENSE file explains details about the distribution of
the library files to application end users. Please read the LICENSE
file carefully. If you can not agree to the distribution conditions,
contact me with details and we can discuss alternatives.

The source code can be compiled for use with Apogee camera hardware
that uses either an ISA or PPI interface. Apogee plans on releasing
a network based camera soon. The library includes conditional code
that accesses an external (DLL) library to communicate with these
cameras from any 32 Bit Windows based platform. If any Linux developers
wants to use the DLL source code or the communications protocol document
to implement network camera access routines under Linux, they should
contact me directly.

The included makefile compiles the library source code for use with
ISA bus cameras by default. Look at the makefile for details on how
to compile the sources for use with PPI based cameras.

This distribution also includes source code for apitest, a small test
program that illustrates the use of the most common library routines,
and can also be used by technical support staff to determine that the
hardware is correctly installed and functioning. You may use the source
code to develope your own applications.

Send any questions or comments about the software development kit to
apogee_support@gkrcc.com
