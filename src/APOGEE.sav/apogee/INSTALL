Installation notes 
------------------

The user manual is on the cdrom in
 
        /opt/apogee/doc
 
in a variety of formats.
 
 

NOTE: Refer to INSTALL-ALTA-E for ALTA network camera instructions.

To install the driver runtime (as superuser aka root)
 
        mkdir /opt
        cd /opt
        tar -xvzpf /mnt/cdrom/apogee-x.y.z-[platform].tgz
 
        (if you will be developing software, install using the
         apogee-devel-x.y.z-[platform].tgz archive instead)

(where x.y.z is the version number)

and if your are using any model except an ALTA-E series one
 
        /opt/apogee/modinstall
 

If you have a USB camera and the modinstall does NOT detect
one of "udev" , "HAL" , or "hotplug" support, then you may
need to use the runtime script /opt/apogee/apps/tcl/scripts/usbpermit.tcl
to give normal user accounts permission to control the camera. 
 
Log in with your normal username
 
 
        /opt/apogee/install
 
answer the questions about your camera model
 
        ~/startapogee
 
to run the camera control GUI.
