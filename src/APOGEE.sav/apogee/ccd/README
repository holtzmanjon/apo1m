This directory contains the source the Ccd tcl extension, built as a 
loadable library.

The Ccd library currently supports named image buffer, some simple 
calibration operations, reading/writing FITS images to disk, and
displaying images in DS9 using shared memory.

Future extensions will include named image arithmatic, WCS coordinate
support, SDL framebuffer display, autoguiding, etc.

This build requires tcl/tk 8.3.1

Type make to build the library.
Copy it to /opt/apogee/lib to install it.
