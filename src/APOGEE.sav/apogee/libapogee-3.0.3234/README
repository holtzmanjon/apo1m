APOGEE IMAGING SYSTEMS LIBRARY:
=============================================================
libapogee provides a C++ API for Apogee Imaging System USB and 
Ethernet cameras and filter wheels.

The interface functions are documented with Doxygen style headers.  If
doxygen is installed on the system during installation then html
documentation will be produced and place in the a doc folder,
typically /usr/local/share/doc/libapogee.  If not please review the
installed header files for more information, i.e. ApogeeCam.h and
doc.h.  Examples are provided in the libapogee/examples folder.
The examples will be built during a "make all".

This distribution also contains the pyLibapogee and jLibapogee subpackages,
which are SWIG generated Python and Java wrappers for libapogee. Examples
of how to use the modules are contained in the
libapogee/ pyLibapogee | jLibapogee /examples folders.

INSTALLATION:
