Application developers must be registered with GKR Computer Consulting before

the camera control library, in any form, without becoming a licensed developer.

Licensed developers can distribute applications that include Apogee camera
control by including one or more binary compilations of the library source
code (that do not contain debug symbols), either statically linked into their
applications, or as a separate binary object file, without any restrictions.

Licensed developers that distribute their entire applications in source code
form, may also include the source code for the camera control library, if the
following restrictions are observed;

1. The camera control source code files are stored in a separate subdirectory
   which includes this license agreement.

2. The camera control library documentation may not be distributed to application
   end users.

3. Application end users are explicitly informed of the restrictions on their
   use of the camera control source code. An example might be a notice that
   appears during application installation and/or compilation.
