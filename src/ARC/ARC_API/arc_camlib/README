Doing a top-level make (from this directory) should compile everything
except cfitsio (which generally should already be compiled).

See the README file in ./astropciV1.7 for instructions on installing
the astropci module.  Basically run make and then run the astropci_load
script as root.  The astropci_load and astropci_unload scripts have
been aliased as apci_load and apci_unload in the observer account
.bashrc with authority to run them as sudo root.

After this, you can try running the testcam program located in ./testcam.
There is a link to the file in ~/bin which should be in the path for
the observer account.
