Astropci Driver Version 1.7 - Fedora Core 4

This driver has been tested under Redhat Fedora Core 4 (kernel 2.6.11-1.1369).
Although it has not been tested, the driver has been written so that it
should compile and run on Fedora Core 2 (kernel 2.4.x).

Changes made to upgrade from Core 2 (kernel 2.4.x) to Core 4 (kernel 2.6.11):
1. Now uses "remap_pfn_range" instead of obsolete "remap_page_range".
2. The "readl", "readw", "writel", and "writew" functions are now defined to
   pass pointer addresses instead of integer addresses.
3. "pci_dev->slot_name" has been replaced with "pci_name(pci_dev)".

IMPORTANT:
---------
The computer must be rebooted after running astropci_unload. This is a
known bug that will cause readout to fail if you do not reboot before
running astropci_load again.

Before compiling, you must make sure the following directory exists. If
it does not, then you must become root and create it. This directory is
where the astropci.ko file will be installed.

/lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra

In order for this driver to function, the following line must be set in
LILO (/etc/lilo.conf) or grub (/etc/grub.conf).

GRUB:
----
Edit the file /etc/grub.conf and append "mem=xxxM" to the end of the
line "kernel /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda2", where xxx is the amount of
RAM you DO NOT want to use for an image buffer. So, if your computer
has 128Mb of RAM and you want to have a 28Mb image buffer, you must
append the following: "mem=100M".

Example:
-------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Edit /etc/grub.conf to append the "mem=xxxM" line:

default=0
timeout=10
splashimage=(hd1,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
title Fedora Core (2.6.5-1.358)
        root (hd1,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.5-1.358 ro root=LABEL=/ rhgb quiet mem=100M
        initrd /initrd-2.6.5-1.358.img
title Other
        rootnoverify (hd0,0)
        chainloader +1

3) Reboot the computer.

To Load The Driver:
------------------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Run ./astropci_load


LILO:
----
append="mem=xxxM", where xxx is the amount of RAM you
DO NOT want to use for an image buffer. So, if your computer has 128Mb of
RAM and you want to have a 28Mb image buffer, you must have the following line
in LILO (/etc/lilo.conf): append="mem=100M".

Example:
-------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Edit /etc/lilo.conf to have the append="mem=xxxM" line:

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.2-2
	label=linux
	read-only
	root=/dev/hda5
	append="mem=100M"

3) From a tcsh, execute the command:  lilo -v

4) Reboot the computer.

To Load The Driver:
------------------
1) Become superuser/root.

2) Run ./astropci_load

The current directory contains the following files:
astropci_main.c:	Main source file. 
astriopci_defs.h: 	General variables and structures definitions
astropci_io.h: 		Entry points for accesing the driver using user-code
			(basically ioctl command definitions)
Makefile: 		Makefile ...
astro_load: 		Simple script for loading the driver to the kernel.
			It will create all the necessary entries for using
	    		the driver. Read the little explanation on the script
	    		itself.
astro_unload: 		Script for unloading the driver from the kernel

When you compile the source, you are going to get the module: astropci.ko.
